Sittin' in my workshop with a plate of fresh cookies
Call my main elf just to see how Abby's doin'

Santa our girl is great and pretty
So give her all the presents and do it early

They call her Abby, what?
My favorite person
Abby, what?
My favorite person

Cutie Abby, my favorite person
They call her that 'cause of all the cuteness
